# GAAL

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dimpon/gaal.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/dimpon/gaal)

It is a POC project.
 
Modular monolith Architecture with strict Architecture boundaries. 
### Tech steck
- Java 11
- Spring Boot 2.1.9
- Gradle 6.7
- JUnit 5
- ArchUnit 0.14.1
- Lombok 1.18.10

### Key features
![image](files/gaal_dependencies.png)

- Code dependencies direct to the most stable component _gaal-common_. It contains DTO, Value Objects, Interfaces, Events
- _gaal-common-beans_ contains beans (services) implementations, interfaces are in _gaal-common_
- _gaal-module1_ contains logic related to specific use cases (e.g. Consolidation). It is absolutely independent. 
   Module enabled by property _module-one.enable=true_ 
- _gaal-module2_ contains logic related to specific use cases (e.g. GraphQL). It is absolutely independent. 
   Module enabled by property _module-two.enable=true_ 
- _gaal-module3_ contains logic related to specific case, it this sample UI. It is absolutely independent. 
   Module enabled by property _module-three.enable=true_ 
 - _gaal-application_ has class with _main()_ method. The module has no dependencies to others modules 

Modules can send brodcast events with payload, and with this way interrogate with others modules. 
Modules also can contain custom implementations of interfaces from _gaal-common_ and these implementations 
can be used by others modules, but via the interface.

Each module has similar architecture structure (as much as possible) and should follow the onion model.
